# Roku Control App

A web-based remote control for your Roku device with app launching capabilities.

## Features

- Save Roku IP address in browser localStorage
- Check device status and connection
- View all installed apps
- Launch any app with one click
- Full remote control (navigation, playback, volume, etc.)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer
- npm

```bash
npm install
```

### Build & Sync Web Assets

Capacitor copies the compiled web assets from `dist/` into each native platform. Rebuild and sync whenever you change HTML/JS/CSS or toddler content:

```bash
npm run build      # compile into dist/
npm run sync       # run build + copy into android/ and electron/
```

## Running the App

### Android (Capacitor)

```bash
npm run android        # builds web assets, syncs, and opens Android Studio
```

From Android Studio you can run on an emulator or a USB-connected device. The Android project has cleartext traffic enabled so the app can talk to your Roku over HTTP on the local network.

### Windows (Electron)

```bash
npm run sync           # build & sync web assets to all platforms
cd electron
npm install            # only needed the first time
npm run electron:start # build once and launch the desktop shell
```

Or use the PowerShell helper to run build â†’ sync â†’ Electron start in one go:

```powershell
./scripts/run-electron.ps1
```

The helper rebuilds, runs `npx cap sync`, copies fresh web assets into `electron/app/`, and finally launches the Electron shell so you always see the latest UI.

You can generate a packaged build (folder output) with:

```bash
npm run electron:pack
```

### Browser Preview (CORS limited)

You can still open `index.html` directly or serve `dist/` with any static server, but Roku devices will reject the requests because of CORS unless you run within the same network and disable CORS in the browser. Native builds are the recommended path.

## Why Capacitor?

The Roku External Control Protocol does not send CORS headers, so browser-based fetches are blocked. The Capacitor builds ship with the native HTTP plugin, letting the app call the Roku over the local network without any extra proxy or cloud hosting.

## Kid Button Content

- Generate or edit `toddler-content.json` with the CLI:
  ```bash
  npm run content -- list
  npm run content -- add-quick --id babyShark --label "Baby Shark" --type youtube --videoId OBqZDyVlFP8
  npm run content -- add-special --id bedtime --label "Bedtime" --emoji "ðŸŒ™" --handler runFavoriteMacro --zone quick
  ```
  Use `npm run content -- --help` to see all commands (init, add-special, add-quick, remove, list).
- Commit the JSON to your git repo (for example on GitHub) and copy the raw file URL. Many teams keep a `content` branch just for the JSON so anyone can PR new buttons without touching the app code.
- In the appâ€™s Settings (after unlocking), paste the raw URL into **Kid Button Source** and click **Save URL & Refresh**. The Electron/Android apps will cache the remote JSON for offline use; you can refresh or clear the cache anytime.
- Prefer a script? Run `./scripts/update-toddler-content.ps1 -Url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/toddler-content.json"` to download the latest remote JSON into the repo (a timestamped backup is created automatically).
- Want a guided workflow? `./scripts/manage-toddler-content.ps1 -Action menu` lists buttons, adds YouTube quick launches, Roku app launchers, or TTS buttons, removes entries, or reinitializes the file through interactive prompts (use `-Action list`, `add-special`, `add-quick`, `add-quick-app`, `add-tts`, etc. for direct commands).

### Unlocking Advanced Settings

- Long-press the gear button in the top-left corner for about two seconds to open the PIN pad (default `1234`).
- After entering the PIN, the advanced sections (connection settings, kid button source, macros, etc.) become visible.
- When you are finished, use the **Hide Advanced Controls** button at the top of the advanced area to tuck everything away again for kid mode.

### Collaboration Tips

- Treat `toddler-content.json` as data: contributors can branch from `main`, run `npm run content -- add-*`, and open a PR that only updates the JSON (and optionally screenshots/assets). After merging, the remote raw URL instantly delivers the new buttons to every build.
- If you keep content on a dedicated branch (e.g., `kid-content`), set the raw URL to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch>/toddler-content.json`. The app will re-fetch on every launch and fall back to cached data if offline.
- Remember to run `npm run sync` after updating toddler content so the packaged Electron/Android app bundles the latest defaults.

## Finding Your Roku IP

1. On your Roku, go to **Settings**
2. Select **Network**
3. Choose **About**
4. Note the IP address and add port `:8060` if your Roku doesnâ€™t display one (for example `192.168.1.120:8060`)
